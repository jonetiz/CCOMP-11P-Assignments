However, recent research and analysis of the building has revealed that the Waldman House was not in fact built by Waldman, and was not originally a ""house"" either. Instead, the structure was a small commercial building with residential quarters on the second floor.  Evidence of this commercial design include a side porch/loading dock facing the alley to the north (since removed); obvious stone in-filling of the first-floor shop-front windows; a large structural beam above the one-time shop front that supported the second-story stonework; photographic evidence from the 1940s of remnants of the original first-floor commercial cornice (see enlarged image below); physical evidence of a central entrance step into the shop; and wooden sleepers that served as nailers for decorative wooden pilasters or perhaps signs at either side of the shop windows below the cornice. Documentary evidence suggests that the stone portion of the building dates to the late fall of 1857, coinciding with the onset of the Panic of 1857. Another unexpected discovery is that parts of the wood frame addition to the rear of the stone building actually predate the stone portion, making the latter the true ""addition."" The research is ongoing, and no doubt the Waldman House has more stories to tell. The house was nominated to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1983 as part of the West Seventh Street Early Limestone Houses Thematic Resource, along with the Joseph Brings House and Martin Weber House.  The Waldman House received an NRHP reference number, #83004866, but the listing was never finalized.  None of the three buildings are officially on the National Register.  It was listed with listing code DR, meaning ""Date Received"" and nomination pending, in 1983."

Early rails were made of wood, cast iron or wrought iron. All modern rails are hot rolled steel with a cross section (profile) approximate to an I-beam, but asymmetric about a horizontal axis (however see grooved rail below). The head is profiled to resist wear and to give a good ride, and the foot profiled to suit the fixing system. Unlike some other uses of iron and steel, railway rails are subject to very high stresses and are made of very high quality steel. It took many decades to improve the quality of the materials, including the change from iron to steel. Minor flaws in the steel that may pose no problems in other applications can lead to broken rails and dangerous derailments when used on railway tracks. By and large, the heavier the rails and the rest of the trackwork, the heavier and faster the trains these tracks can carry. Rails represent a substantial fraction of the cost of a railway line. Only a small number of rail sizes are made by steelworks at one time, so a railway must choose the nearest suitable size. Worn, heavy rail from a mainline is often reclaimed and downgraded for re-use on a branchline, siding or yard."

Fascinated by horses, Gricault made many paintings portraying them. Working for a while at the imperial stables at Versailles, he had the opportunity to study them in detail and made numerous portraits of horses. Other paintings of horses by Gricault include  Officer Hunter Horse of the Imperial Guard Charging (1812) and Race of Free Horses in Rome (1819).This work is a rare and valuable example of painting dated from his travel in England, when Gricault preferred to work in lithography. It was painted for the English horse dealer Adam Elmore. The race itself was won by Gustavus, becoming the first grey to win the race. The painting was acquired by the Muse du Louvre in 1866.The position of the horses' legs in the painting - with both front and hind legs extended outwards while airborne - is never actually exhibited by a galloping horse. This was discovered by Eadweard Muybridge in 1878, who showed using high-speed photography that galloping horses are airborne when their legs are beneath the body, just before the hind legs touch ground."

Pianos are usually tuned to a modified version of the system called equal temperament. (See Piano key frequencies for the theoretical piano tuning.) In all systems of tuning, every pitch may be derived from its relationship to a chosen fixed pitch, which is usually A440 (440 Hz), the note A above middle C. Note that for a classical piano and musical theory, the middle C is usually labelled as C4 (as in scientific pitch notation); However, in the MIDI standard definition this middle C (261.626 Hz) is labelled C3. In practice, a MIDI software can label middle C as C3-C5, which can cause confusion, especially for beginners. Piano tuning is done by a wide range of independent piano technicians, piano rebuilders, piano-store technical personnel, and hobbyists. Professional training and certification is available from organizations or guilds, such as the Piano Technicians Guild. Many piano manufacturers recommend that pianos be tuned twice a year.  "

The candy was invented by Thomas Tate Tidwell Sr., later popularized by The Charms Candy Company.  Blow Pops became the Charms Candy Company's best-selling product of all time. In 1988, the Charms Candy Company was sold to Tootsie Roll Industries. With the addition of Blow Pops to their product line which included Tootsie Rolls, the Tootsie Roll Company became the largest lollipop manufacturer in the world.   Walter W. Reid Jr. founded the Charms Candy Company in 1912. The company was originally called Tropical Charms, a reference to the individually wrapped square-shaped hard candies, which were one of the first to be individually wrapped in cellophane.Tropical Charms was founded in Bloomfield, New Jersey. The company name was eventually shortened to Charms. During World War II, the U.S. Army began including Charms candies in combat rations as a supplemental energy form. That tradition has continued with a few interruptions. After the war, Walter Reid III, the son of the founder, took control of the company and made it the leading producer of hard candy in the world. The company was led by Reid III, Ross B. Cameron Sr. (Walter W. Reid Jr.s son-in-law) and his two sons, Ross B. Cameron Jr. and Reid B. Cameron. Charms developed a wide variety of confections. 1937 - 1950s Charms started producing pecan filled chocolate bars called ""25 Carats"" made with The Hershey Company top grade chocolate (at that time, Hershey had 3 grades of chocolate). The chocolate candy was discontinued due to the high margin cost and other internal problems. In the 1960s beside making other Holiday candy lollipops they also produced Charms ""Jellies"" and Chuckles Gum Drops. Later they created a peanut butter filled hard candy in the shape of a peanut. On Nov. 28, 1966, Thomas T. Tidwell, founder of Triple T. Co. Inc., filed a patent for Method for making candy with gum inside. Triple T initially marketed the product as the Triple Treat. In 1973, Triple T sold the idea to Charms, where it was renamed the Blow Pop. Blow Pops come in watermelon, strawberry, cherry, grape, and sour apple flavors (sour apple was introduced later and was originally round like an apple). The Charms Candy Company moved its manufacturing plant from Bloomfield, NJ to Freehold, NJ in 1973. The company eventually purchased and built a state-of-the-art manufacturing plant in Covington, Tennessee, which is currently still being used to produce Charms candies. Besides the Blow Pop, the candy company produced Charms Squares, Sweet & Sour Pops, Sour Balls and many other smaller candy products."

Qu Tongfeng was born in Fushan County, now in Yantai, Fushan District of Shandong. At age 16 he joined the Beiyang Fleet and served as second-class engineer on the Dingyuan during the First SinoJapanese War. When the ship was sunk in the Battle of the Yalu River he escaped into the sea and was rescued. He went on to get a higher education and was sent to the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1903, graduating in 1904. Upon his return he was given an infantry unit command. In 1907 he was given posts in the Beiyang Army in charge of drill, discipline and inspection. In 1910 he was promoted to command of a unit in Yunnan.  Following the 1911 Wuchang Uprising Qu rose in revolt, becoming commander of the 2nd Division. In 1912 he was promoted to Major General. He was President of the Baoding Military Academy from 1913 to 1915. He was removed after opposing Yuan Shikai's capitulation to the Twenty-One Demands. Following the death of Yuan Shikai, Qu was given military commands again by the Anhui clique.   In 1920 he was the Anhui army front-line commander-in-chief in the ZhiliAnhui War. Wu Peifu led the Zhili clique army in a daring maneuver to capture the Anhui army headquarters after first outflanking the enemy, capturing Qu and many of his fellow officers. He was released from captivity in 1922. Qu Tongfeng was shot in Tianjin in 1929.  "

It is typically removable, rewritable and much smaller than an optical disc. Most weigh less than 30 g (1 oz). Since first appearing on the market in late 2000, as with virtually all other computer memory devices, storage capacities have risen while prices have dropped. As of March 2016, flash drives with anywhere from 8 to 256 gigabytes (GB) were frequently sold, while 512 GB and 1 terabyte (TB) units were less frequent. As of 2018, 2 TB flash drives were the largest available in terms of storage capacity. Some allow up to 100,000 write/erase cycles, depending on the exact type of memory chip used, and are thought to physically last between 10 and 100 years under normal circumstances (shelf storage time). Common uses of USB flash drives are for storage, supplementary back-ups, and transferring of computer files. Compared with floppy disks or CDs, they are smaller, faster, have significantly more capacity, and are more durable due to a lack of moving parts.  Additionally, they are less vulnerable to electromagnetic interference than floppy disks, and are unharmed by surface scratches (unlike CDs). However, as with any flash storage, data loss from bit leaking due to prolonged lack of electrical power and the possibility of spontaneous controller failure due to poor manufacturing could make it unsuitable for long-term archival of data. The ability to retain data is affected by the controller's firmware, internal data redundancy, and error correction algorithms.Until about 2005, most desktop and laptop computers were supplied with floppy disk drives in addition to USB ports, but floppy disk drives became obsolete after widespread adoption of USB ports and the larger USB drive capacity compared to the ""1.44 megabyte"" (1440 kilobyte) 3.5-inch floppy disk. USB flash drives use the USB mass storage device class standard, supported natively by modern operating systems such as Windows, Linux, macOS and other Unix-like systems, as well as many BIOS boot ROMs. USB drives with USB 2.0 support can store more data and transfer faster than much larger optical disc drives like CD-RW or DVD-RW drives and can be read by many other systems such as the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, DVD players, automobile entertainment systems, and in a number of handheld devices such as smartphones and tablet computers, though the electronically similar SD card is better suited for those devices, due to their standardized form factor, which allows it to be housed inside a device without protruding. A flash drive consists of a small printed circuit board carrying the circuit elements and a USB connector, insulated electrically and protected inside a plastic, metal, or rubberized case, which can be carried in a pocket or on a key chain, for example. Some are equipped with an I/O indication LED that lights up or blinks upon access. The USB connector may be protected by a removable cap or by retracting into the body of the drive, although it is not likely to be damaged if unprotected. Most flash drives use a standard type-A USB connection allowing connection with a port on a personal computer, but drives for other interfaces also exist (e.g. micro-USB and USB-C ports). USB flash drives draw power from the computer via the USB connection. Some devices combine the functionality of a portable media player with USB flash storage; they require a battery only when used to play music on the go."

His choice of subjects as a painter was wide; he painted figures, portraits, still-life and landscapes.  He painted in oil and watercolor. He was self-taught. He was attracted to Surrealism in 1930 and as a member of the Birmingham Group, joined the Surrealist Group in 1938. He was a contributor to the London Bulletin in 1939, and to Arson in 1942.John exhibited his work first in London at the Wertheim Gallery in 1932. He continued to exhibit in other venues in London and throughout the UK. His work is represented in a number of private and public collections.  His paintings often showed transformed figures and a dream-like, unexpected conjunction of images. During the 1940s, he painted portraits and still-life but later returned to Surrealism.Melville's relative isolation led to his work being somewhat neglected.  However, in recent years his reputation has grown and his singular style has led to his inclusion in a number of public exhibitions - notably ""Surrealism: Two Private Eyes"" at the Guggenheim, New York in 1999 and ""Surrealism in Birmingham"" in 2001."
