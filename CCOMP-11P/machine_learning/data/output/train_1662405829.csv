It can be due to an increase in the number of red blood cells (""absolute polycythemia"") or to a decrease in the volume of plasma (""relative polycythemia""). Polycythemia is sometimes called erythrocytosis, but the terms are not synonymous, because polycythemia describes any increase in red blood mass (whether due to an erythrocytosis or not), whereas erythrocytosis is a documented increase of red cell count. The emergency treatment of polycythemia (e.g., in hyperviscosity or thrombosis) is by phlebotomy (removal of blood from the circulation). Depending on the underlying cause, phlebotomy may also be used on a regular basis to reduce the hematocrit. Myelosuppressive medications such as hydroxyurea are sometimes used for long-term management of polycythemia."

Since the beginning of the 1970s, he began to compose and write and even to play in the carnival. He was accompanied by accordionist Walter Haarhaus. To emulate their role models, the Eilemann Trio, a bassist, Paul Rumpen, joined the group, followed two years later by Oliver Hoff. Their breakthrough had the group with the songs ""Ja die Oma will nach Palma"" and ""Bier und nen Appelkorn"". For the ice hockey club Klner Haie the group composed and produced in 1980 the fan anthem ""Wir sind die Haie"".

At the collegiate level, the most common name is Student Government, according to the American Student Government Association's database of all student governments throughout the United States. The next most common name is the student government association. Other names are student senate, associated students (west coast institutions almost exclusively), or less commonly students' union. There is one instance of a government of the student body, at Iowa State University. At Yale University, the undergraduate student government is known as the Yale College Council. High school student governments usually are known as Student Council. Student governments vary widely in their internal structure and degree of influence on institutional policy.  At institutions with large graduate, medical school, and individual ""college"" populations, there are often student governments that serve those specific constituencies.  Some student governments have very large budgets; the student government at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) had an annual budget of $39 million as of 2013, and the Florida International University Student Government had an annual budget of $20.3 million as of 2021.Elsewhere in the world, student governments are often known as ""student unions"". However, in American English, the phrase ""student union"" often refers to a ""student activity center"" (also known as a ""student center"" or ""student commons""): a building with dining halls, game rooms, lounges, student offices, and other spaces for student activities.Not all American colleges and universities have a separate student government.  A handful of small liberal arts colleges in the United States use a governance model in which key decisions are made democratically by the community as a whole, with students and faculty on equal footing.  Examples of such schools include Marlboro College, Shimer College, and College of the Atlantic. In addition, historically, many US schools followed a ""student-faculty council"" model, with governance shared between elected representatives of the student body and the faculty."

Arguments from morality tend to be based on moral normativity or moral order. Arguments from moral normativity observe some aspect of morality and argue that God is the best or only explanation for this, concluding that God must exist. Arguments from moral order are based on the asserted need for moral order to exist in the universe. They claim that, for this moral order to exist, God must exist to support it. The argument from morality is noteworthy in that one cannot evaluate the soundness of the argument without attending to almost every important philosophical issue in meta-ethics. German philosopher Immanuel Kant devised an argument from morality based on practical reason. Kant argued that the goal of humanity is to achieve perfect happiness and virtue (the summum bonum) and believed that an afterlife must exist in order for this to be possible, and that God must exist to provide this. In his book Mere Christianity, C. S. Lewis argued that ""conscience reveals to us a moral law whose source cannot be found in the natural world, thus pointing to a supernatural Lawgiver."" Lewis argued that accepting the validity of human reason as a given must include accepting the validity of practical reason, which could not be valid without reference to a higher cosmic moral order which could not exist without a God to create and/or establish it. A related argument is from conscience; John Henry Newman argued that the conscience supports the claim that objective moral truths exist because it drives people to act morally even when it is not in their own interest. Newman argued that, because the conscience suggests the existence of objective moral truths, God must exist to give authority to these truths. Contemporary defenders of the argument from morality are Graham Ward, Alister McGrath and William Lane Craig."

This smoking is accomplished either as a cold smoke of the raw leaves as they are processed or as a hot smoke of previously processed (withered and oxidized) leaves. The intensity of the smoke aroma can be varied by locating the leaves closer or farther (or higher or lower in a multi-level facility) from the source of heat and smoke or by adjusting the duration of the process. The flavour and aroma of lapsang souchong is described as containing empyreumatic notes, including wood smoke, pine resin, smoked paprika, and dried longan; it may be mixed with milk but is not bitter and usually not sweetened with sugar. The tea originates from the Wuyi Mountains region of Fujian, China and is considered a Wuyi tea (or bohea).  It is also produced in Taiwan (Formosa). It has been labelled as smoked tea (), Zheng Shan Xiao Zhong, smoky souchong, tarry lapsang souchong, and lapsang souchong crocodile. While the tea leaf grading system adopted the term souchong to refer to a particular leaf position, lapsang souchong may be made with any leaf of the Camellia sinensis plant, though it is not unusual for the lower leaves, which are larger and less flavourful, to be used as the smoking compensates for the lower flavour profile and the higher leaves are more valuable for use in unflavoured or unblended teas. In addition to its consumption as a tea, lapsang souchong is also used in stock for soups, stews and sauces or otherwise as a spice or seasoning.  "

Warburg's hypothesis suggests that tumor cells proliferate quickly and aggressively by obtaining energy or ATP, through high glucose consumption and lactate production. When tumor cells are found in an obesity environment, the researchers perceive that the cells instead of consuming glucose in glycolysis produce glucose through gluconeogenesis using as substrates the lactate that instead of being produced is consumed. The authors explain that this is due to the increase in nutrients that are found in an obese organism and that the cell obtains energy through more caloric nutrients such as fatty acids that are completely oxidized through the Krebs cycle followed by oxidative phosphorylation."
